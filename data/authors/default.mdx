## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Farhan Aziz

I'm a Software Engineer <Twemoji emoji="laptop" /> with two years of hands-on experience in web-based applications. Based in Indonesia, I’m passionate about creating smooth, user-friendly digital experiences by diving into both front-end and back-end development. My focus is on delivering high-quality solutions that not only meet business needs but also keep users at the heart of the design.

Currently, I’m enhancing my skills by working with diverse tech stacks and continuously improving my coding practices to follow industry standards. Whether I’m collaborating with a team or taking the lead on projects, I make sure every detail aligns with our goals and meets top-notch quality.

Outside of coding, you’ll find me unwinding with a good movie <Twemoji emoji="movie" /> or diving into the latest tech trends <Twemoji emoji="rocket" />, always on the lookout for fresh inspiration. There's always a new challenge on the horizon, and I'm all about tackling it head-on!
